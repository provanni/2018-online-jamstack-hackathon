# Fauna
#### Quick Description
A cloud database with generous free plan and distributed ACID transactions for global data integrity. Get started easily and scale to worldwide success.

### Purpose
Stores transactional data like account balances, user profiles, social media content, shopping cart orders, etc.

##### API endpoint:
Install with the netlify command line tool after you have linked your checkout to your app, by running `netlify addons:create fauna` and you can access your database with environment variables like this:

```js
const client = new faunadb.Client({
  secret: process.env.FAUNADB_SERVER_SECRET
});
```

### Challenges

A common pattern with Single Page Apps is for the browser to query a cloud database directly. FaunaDB access control supports apps like this. A [demo app using the Netlify Identity service and login widget to authenticate with FaunaDB is available here.](https://github.com/fauna/netlify-faunadb-todomvc) Follow the eight steps in the README and you'll be ready to build your own app.

### Docs

The [FaunaDB Query API docs](https://app.fauna.com/documentation/reference/queryapi) are a good reference.

For [getting started with the data model, this tutorial is good.](https://app.fauna.com/documentation/howto/crud) And when you log into fauna.com (not required to get started) you can [learn more about the Fauna Shell and other tools here.](https://app.fauna.com/account)

### Video tutorial

I'll walk through these steps live during the Hackathon keynote.

### Presentation slides

Coming soon.

### Prizes

Coming soon.

# Formspree

https://formspree.io

### Purpose

Formspree is a form backend that emails you when someone submits your forms. It’s the simplest way to add custom contact forms, order forms, or email capture forms to your JAMstack website. Once you connect your form to our endpoint we’ll email you the submissions. No PHP, Javascript or sign up required.

### API endpoint

To use formspree with an existing HTML form you must:

1. change the `action` of your form to point to `https://formspree.io/<YOUR EMAIL>`
2. make sure the `method` is `POST`, and
3. give a `name` attribute to all your `input` tags.

For example:

```html
<form action="https://formspree.io/your@email.com" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="name">
  <input type="email" name="_replyto">
  <input type="submit" value="Send">
</form>
```

Try playing around with formspree in our sandbox at https://testformspree.com 

### Challenges

Get a "contact us" form set up on your website! 

Set up a serverless function to respond to a webhook each time a user submits the form, then fetch the content and use it to do something coool....

### Docs
Using formspree is as easy as the `API endpoint` instructions. Try playing around with formspree at https://testformspree.com.

You can have more control of how your forms are handled by formspree by adding special `type="hidden"` inputs. See the docs below for a list of the special input names that you can use. 

https://formspree.io/docs/

You can also find answers to common questions on our help site here:

https://help.formspree.io/

Finally, we will be here in the discord `#formspree-api` chat room to help you! Just look for the formspree logo. 

<img src="https://formspree.io/img/formspree-logo-mark.png" width="250px">

### API (Beta)

We just launched an API beta. Check out the docs here: https://formspree.io/api. 

We're continuing to add to those docs so check back occasionally. Also check out the Discord `#formspree-api` room for updates.

Finally we're gonna offer coupons to people who want to test out our Gold / Platinum features (including APIs). Let us know in discord if you want free access.

### Video tutorial
Nothing yet, but maybe we'll have one of these posted soon...



### Prizes

Off-site participants that use Formspree will be eligible to win an Amazon Gift Card worth $200. If Amazon gift cards aren't available in your country we will work with you to come up with an equivalent prize.

# Clarifai
#### Quick Description
Clarifai's API offers image and video recognition capabilities.

The API is built around a simple idea: you send inputs (an image or video) to the service and it returns predictions. The type of prediction is based on what model you choose. For example, if you run your input through the pre-trained 'food' model, the predictions it returns will contain concepts that the 'food' model knows about. If you run your input through the 'color' model, it will return predictions about the dominant colors in your image. The 'General' model covers a broad array of common concepts. A full list of models is available here: https://clarifai.com/models.

### Purpose
Use the Clarifai API if you want to add image understanding to your JAMstack app. Two common use cases are analyzing what is in an image and visual (image-based) search.

Clarifai can recognize over 10,000 concepts out-of-the-box with default settings ("General" model). You can also quickly train a model to recognize new concepts based on images you upload and label. You can see a complete list of pre-trained models you can use here: https://clarifai.com/models

##### API endpoint:
https://api.clarifai.com/v2

We recommend using a client library to access the API (makes it easier). There are clients available for most languages, including JavaScript: https://clarifai.com/developer/reference/

### Challenges
+ Get JSON results from Clarifai's "General" model for an image of your choice.
(Hint: https://clarifai.com/developer/guide/predict#predict)

++ Train your model to recognize a new object or concept (using at least 10 images as labeled examples)
(Hint: https://clarifai.com/developer/guide/train#train)

### Docs
Developer Guide (start here): https://clarifai.com/developer/guide/
Technical Reference and Client Libraries: https://clarifai.com/developer/reference/
JavaScript API endpoint reference: https://sdk.clarifai.com/js/latest/index.html

# Hasura

Hasura gives you instant, realtime GraphQL APIs for your JAMstack app. With one-click to deploy on Heroku's free tier, you can get started in less than a minute.

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-heroku)

You don't need to know how to write a GraphQL schema, resolvers or learn how to use
a database to get started! Head to the deployed app, create a table, and run CRUD + realtime with GraphQL :)

![Hasura demo GIF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/master/assets/demo.gif)

You can also use Hasura to trigger Lambda/Serverless functions such as [Netlify
Functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/) when an event happens on the
database, for example, send an email when a new user is added.

### Purpose

You should use Hasura if your JAMstack app needs to CRUD data, needs a realtime API,
or if you want to trigger webhooks on data changes.

Here are some examples of how you can use Hasura:
- CRUD operations with GraphQL ([sample app](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/examples/todo-auth0-jwt))
- Building a realtime app (sample apps: [chat](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/examples/realtime-chat), [poll](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/examples/realtime-poll), [location tracking](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/examples/realtime-location-tracking))
- Sourcing the data for a gatsby site from a postgres database ([sample app](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/boilerplates/gatsby-postgres-graphql))
- Triggering browser-based notifications if some data changes ([sample app](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/examples/serverless-push))

### Learn in 5 minutes (video tutorials)

Here are a few short videos to help you get started:

1. Explore GraphQL queries, mutations and subscriptions with a realtime todo app [(video coming soon)]()
2. Send an email when a new user is created using Netlify functions [(video coming soon)]()
3. Integrate authentication/authorization with auth0 [(video coming soon)]()

### Support & help

- Join the [Hasura discord server](https://discord.gg/vBPpJkS). We're super active and someone from the team or the community will help out any time of the day if you have any questions!
- Tanmai will be hanging around at the hackathon if you're present offline! Do say Hi and ask him as many questions as you'd like:
