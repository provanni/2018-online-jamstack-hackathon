## How is this hackathon different?

Most hackathons focus principally on the end-goal -- the product. While this hackathon places a significant amount of focus on the end-product as well, we are also placing a significant amount of focus in the *process* of how you approach building your project.

### The Process -- what it means

Building great software isn't just about the code you write. Your planned approach to building it is just as important. So here's what this means for you as a hacker at this hackathon:
* Judges will pose a number of questions for you, and share them with you in the Discord group to see how you are handling your approach to building your app. Do you have a plan of action? Are you organized in your list of responsibilities and dividing tasks? Are the goals realistic given the limited time frame?
* Your answers to these questions will be a small percentage of your overall judging score.


## Code of Conduct
By attending the hackathon, or participating remotely, you affirm that you have read and agree to our Code of Conduct, and you will abide by its guidelines laid out here: https://jamstackconf.com/code-of-conduct  

Note: This code applies to both in-person and online interaction. Violations will not be tolerated.

## Purpose
The Hackathon is designed to be a fun and educational environment. Of course there will also be competition for prizes -- but our main goal is education, building community, and learning to use some cool APIs and technologies!

## Team Size
* Max team size: 6
* Recommended team size: 3-5
